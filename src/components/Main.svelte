                You will most likely (probably not) know me from my music which is available on most major platforms.
                I am <span class="poppins text-green-700">18 years old</span> and my favorite activity is <span class="poppins text-green-700">creating art</span>, be it visual or auditory.
                This has been my favorite thing to do for many years and at one point I decided I should get myself out there and make myself known to the public.
                I started with a cheap guitar and some lessons, which quickly peaked my interest in writing my own little riffs. <br />
                At the same time I got into electronic dance music and I thought that it was truly magical. To make people feel something but get them headbanging at the same time.
                A while later I started my music production journey with the demo version of FL Studio, making horrendous "tracks" (if you can even call them that),
                but at the time it wasn't about making festival bangers, it was about jumping into the cold water and learning to swim in digital signals. <br>
                Fast forward to <span class="poppins text-green-700">today</span>... I have released my first few tracks and am planning to release many more in the future.
